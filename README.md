# Predictive Analysis of iPhone Purchases

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from a predictive study on iPhone purchases. The project focuses on understanding the influencing factors behind iPhone acquisitions using demographic data such as gender, age, and salary.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Jupyter Notebook Analysis:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`iphone_prj5.ipynb`) for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis steps.
   - Utilize the provided comments and explanations to understand the process.

2. **Explore Tableau Visualizations:**
   - Navigate to the `TableauVisualization` directory.
   - Open the Tableau workbook to interact with visualizations and gain a holistic view of the data.

## Project Conclusion

The analysis uncovered significant insights into iPhone purchase behavior, emphasizing the impact of age and income on buying decisions. Outliers were identified and addressed, contributing to the robustness of the analysis. The developed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model demonstrated an 88.75% accuracy in predicting iPhone purchases.

## Additional Information

- The provided Jupyter Notebook includes comprehensive commentary for each analysis step.
- The Tableau dashboard enhances user experience, allowing for dynamic exploration of the dataset.

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and predicting iPhone purchases based on demographic factors.


# Project Title: Predicting Price per Sqft with Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the price per square foot using a Linear Regression model based on a dataset with 7120 rows and 108 columns. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, balcony presence, total square footage, and various location indicators.

## Solution Overview
### Components
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Linear Regression Modeling**

### Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Importing necessary packages.
   - Loading and exploring the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Copying data for preprocessing.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducting correlation analysis.
   - Creating a heatmap for selected variables.
   - Visualizing data for insights.

4. **Linear Regression Modeling**
   - Selecting relevant features for the model.
   - Training a Linear Regression model using sklearn.
   - Evaluating the model with metrics (R-squared Score, RMSE).

## Business Impact
### Key Takeaways
- Improved Decision-making
- Enhanced Customer Satisfaction
- Operational Efficiency

## Conclusion
This project successfully predicts the price per square foot with a Linear Regression model, achieving a satisfactory R-squared score of 77.58%. Further analysis and model refinement are recommended for future enhancements.
