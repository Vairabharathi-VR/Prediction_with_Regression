# Predictive Analysis of iPhone Purchases

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from a predictive study on iPhone purchases. The project focuses on understanding the influencing factors behind iPhone acquisitions using demographic data such as gender, age, and salary.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Jupyter Notebook Analysis:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`iphone_prj5.ipynb`) for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis steps.
   - Utilize the provided comments and explanations to understand the process.

2. **Explore Tableau Visualizations:**
   - Navigate to the `TableauVisualization` directory.
   - Open the Tableau workbook to interact with visualizations and gain a holistic view of the data.

## Project Conclusion

The analysis uncovered significant insights into iPhone purchase behavior, emphasizing the impact of age and income on buying decisions. Outliers were identified and addressed, contributing to the robustness of the analysis. The developed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model demonstrated an 88.75% accuracy in predicting iPhone purchases.

## Additional Information

- The provided Jupyter Notebook includes comprehensive commentary for each analysis step.
- The Tableau dashboard enhances user experience, allowing for dynamic exploration of the dataset.

This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding and predicting iPhone purchases based on demographic factors.
